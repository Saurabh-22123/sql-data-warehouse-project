# End-to-End SQL Data Warehouse Project

You are welcomed to **SQL Data Warehouse Project** repository. 
This repository showcases a complete, end-to-end data engineering lifecycle. It demonstrates how to transform fragmented raw data from ERP and CRM systems into a high-performance Star Schema to drive business intelligence.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project utilizes a multi-layered (**Bronze**, **Silver** & **Gold**) approach to ensure data integrity and performance:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Acts as the landing zone for raw data. CSV files are ingested directly into the SQL Server environment in their original state.
2. **Silver Layer**: The "Source of Truth." This stage handles data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to ensure high data quality.
3. **Gold Layer**: The consumption layer. Data is modeled into a Star Schema, optimized for high-performance reporting and business intelligence.
